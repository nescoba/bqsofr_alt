Correct way to write the statement in Wikipedia

Let (S, Omega) be a measurable space, H a probability measure on S and alpha a number
Let P(S) be the measurable space of probability measures on S
Then DP is a measure on P(S) determined by the property that
The finite dimensional marginals are DIrichlet
