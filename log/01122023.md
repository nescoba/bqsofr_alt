| 10:24 | Implemented Stan code for fbqror algorithm. Code in code/fbqror_test |
|       | Rstan is working on my personal computer. For Mac I'm thinking       |
|       | virtual machine. It might be useful anyway, including for SAS        |
| 15:22 | Meeting with R. Mixture representation is for Gibbs, not good for    |
|       | Stan. Define the distro in brms so that you don't have to write      |
|       | in Stan. End goal is quantile regression with functional             |
|       | covariates                                                           |
