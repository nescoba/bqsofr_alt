| 09:17 | continuing with functions part of the Stan User Guide                |
| 10:37 | this is just not very efficient. User guide is not really structured |
|       | as one. I did learn a lot from it, but there is still a lot          |
|       | that's not clear. But I'm afraid I can only learn that from          |
|       | practice                                                             |
| 11:30 | basically same comment for brms                                      |
| 11:33 | before I read the papers, I need to know what quantile regression is |
| 12:51 | the idea of quantile regression is very interesting. But it's mostly |
|       | the motivation. The actual model is described in equations 7         |
|       | and 8. Simply, it's a latent random variable model, where the        |
|       | error term has the GAL distribution. So, the task is simple:         |
|       | generate some synthetic random data like that and try to estimate    |
|       | the parameters.                                                      |
| 13:00 | wait, why would we use brms though? and how? does brms allow for     |
|       | latent variables? And the other thing is that brms makes sense       |
|       | for multilevel models. But this one is not. So maybe this is         |
|       | not a brms tast, this is a Stan task. Maybe it's the other paper     |
|       | that would make use of brms                                          |
| 14:41 | Just a note on software. I installed Xcode (administrator            |
|       | permisions were needed) so that I would have a C++ compiler. This    |
|       | was necessary for brms, which I also installed succesfully. Rstan    |
|       | needs the macOS R toolchain, which also requires admin priviledges   |
| 15:00 | I generated the synthetic data succesfully                           |
| 17:00 | I wrote both the R code and the Stan code. Can't run it w.o. rstan   |
