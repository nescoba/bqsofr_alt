I was wrong in thinking that the way this works is by fitting separate instances of the GAL distribution for every value of x.
All Stan can do is compute likelihoods
So each observation gets inputed to the likelihood according to the corresponding coefficients
But it's a 'single' lpdf function being used along the way

Hence, when generating the data, I don't have to create a bunch of ys for the same x

It's tricky to be thinking about the logs all the time, let's just make the link function to be the identity

Realized that I have to redefine the GAL2 function everytime we change the q
