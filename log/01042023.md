| 11:10 | what we're doing now is the same as before but with non-gaussian  |
|       | responses. It gets a lot more complicated because of the need for |
|       | Fisher iterations to estimate the initial point, but more         |
|       | importantly, because it requires a MH step. The other challenge   |
|       | is to write this in Nimble                                        |
| 11:14 | Actually, Nimble makes it kind of trivial, because it basically   |
|       | handles the MCMC part by itself                                   |
| 13:03 | And Nimble did it. It does save so much time and effort.          |
|       | algorithm_2_2.r has the implementation.                           |
