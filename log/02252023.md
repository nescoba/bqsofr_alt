Divergences dissapeared once I considered data with exponentially increasing heteroskedasticity.

A lot of questions still open about the divergence issues.
Good to know that there is at least one regime in which sampling works well.

What happens if we push it a little?
If we put coefficients in the exponential, what happens?
what if the data is not mean centered?
what if we consider a longer range for $x$? Does the exponential growth breaks everything?

But what's special about that regime?
Is it the link function?
Or is it just the fact that the $\sigma$ was not 0 at 0?

The question is whether it is worth considering these questions.
Because there are other questions to address
like the mixing of GALs
and the mediation thing
and thinking about the censored data

I decided to push the results
when fitting data such that $\sigma = \exp(2x)$, the sampling works well if we demand that BRMS fits $\sigma$. If not, divergences reappear.
