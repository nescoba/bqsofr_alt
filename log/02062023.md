where are we? what are next steps?

No need to overthink
list of possible things to do:

- implementing more complicated data and trying to fit the quantiles with the s thing, changing the bs parameter
- making sure that brms doesn't fit an intercept when estimating sigma, and maybe making it more complex
- doing the emeans thing
- try out the code with different distributions
- think about censored data
- look into the divergence after warmup errors

Writing a quarto document analyzing the questions outlined above.
It's named by date and it's stored in the 'experimenting' branch of the forked BQSoFR repository

Fit for the homoskedastic, sinusoidal data was quite good

I should add posterior predictive checks to some of the things I'm including
Actually, how am I doing posterior predictive?

## 16:40

I tried the first two things from the list above. Fits are pretty nice.
