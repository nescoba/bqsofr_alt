Something else

Nimble doesn't quite perform
Rstan is better, robust, extendable, support

he has done the gibbs, etc

that is unpracticeal for big models

brms
uses Stan in the background
it also shows the code

sintax:
prior
model formula
can include s(), for gam stuff

look into stan, brms

brms produces stan code
which can be used to do prior checking easily

different approach to sample from the posterior

creating our own distribution
it just needs the log-likelihood

try out the brms thing
try to change the basis functions

s and t2 functions from GAM

understand what the choice of arguments does
especially the bs

try out and share with him

take a look at Stan too
