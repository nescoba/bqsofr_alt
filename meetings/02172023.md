what happens in heteroskedasticity scenario?
sigma = sigma(x)
for normal distribution, quantile as a function x
how well does the GAL perform in modeling the quantile in that case?
fit modeling sigma and wo sigma

show the two lines, fitting with and wo sigma(x)
two different functions of sigma
linear and quadratic

how to simulate survival time data

put mixture on hte side

.1, .5 and .75, .25
