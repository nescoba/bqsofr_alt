paper 1, quantile regression, mixture distribution
current paper: that + functional + scalar function regression with measurement error
MCMC implemented and works
trying to implement in NIMBLE and Julia
especially Julia because its powerful and easy to specify model
examples in the documentation
Turing in Julia
code samplers
understanding Julia
he sends me the code and I try to make it faster
monitor discord with discussion
optimize code to make it run faster is the main goal

the paper:
mgcv package in R
handling basis functions in R
estimating nonlinear models

incorporating R code in Julia
especially to get basis functions
