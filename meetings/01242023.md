gamma, student errors
function of covariates

errors when running
divergence after warmup
trace back

compute quantile based on eq 7
invert F_p_0

how to tweak
create sigma[n]
target += GAL2_lpdf... sigma[n]....

start thinking about model checking with brms
posterior predictive
prior predictive
how do you make sense of it?
