L, U h_raw
(11) is for Gibbs
Stan is better with the direct distro
let's not write from scratch
in the gamma=0 case, is AL
Bd[1]\*.99 so that it's not in the bdry

try the up part of the code
simulate from normal, compute the quantile

run until 230

actually 228
get rid of the prior in 230

can we use brms to estimate quantiles of censored data
functional covariate no error
then with error
